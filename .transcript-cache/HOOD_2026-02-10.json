So let's get right into it, shall we? As a reminder, we are focused on our three-part strategy: number one in active traders, number one in wallet share for the next generation, and our long-term mark, number one global financial ecosystem. Looking back on 2025, it was an incredible year with incredible product velocity across all three of our arcs. First, active traders. We want active traders to feel like they are at a disadvantage trading anywhere but Robinhood Markets, Inc. It's a big priority for us, and we are seeing big results.\n\nIn Q4, prediction market volumes doubled, more than doubled yet again, with over 12 billion contracts traded in 2025, which is the first full year of prediction markets. Customers have already traded over 4 billion so far in 2026, so we are seeing the momentum continue. We also expanded our equities offering with the launch of shorting. We love giving our customers more tools to navigate the markets, and we see them responding. Over 11 billion of equity notional volume in the first couple of months since shorting went out. Second, wallet share. We continue to make progress building out our financial super app and becoming our customer's primary and secondary financial account.\n\nSo a lot of attention typically goes to our active trading offerings, and it should, but we have also been making a ton of progress broadening our offering and attracting more long-term investing to the platform. Over 40% of our total assets are now across ETFs, advisory, retirement, and cash. So it's great to see customers trusting us with more of their financial lives. Robinhood Gold Card, up over five times in 2025 to 600,000 customers, has reached over 10 billion in annualized spend. Customers love the product. They love the 3% rewards, but also the intuitive user experience, the metal card, and the solid gold card, and capabilities like single-use cards and all the family features.\n\nAs we have been rolling out the card, we built increasing confidence in the economics. So we plan to continue accelerating the rollout, more than doubling the number of customers with gold cards this year to well over a million by the end of the year. Robinhood banking. So we began the rollout of Robinhood banking in the past few months. Customers are really excited about this. We are building the kind of banking experience that was once limited to the ultra-wealthy. Strong early results with our initial over 25,000 funded customers who have brought in over 400 million in balances.\n\nAnd perhaps the thing that gets me most excited, over 50% of our funded customers using banking enrolled in direct deposit. So as we look at this, it makes us more confident that we are achieving product market fit with this offering. Now, third arc, global financial ecosystem, our long-term arc. We are making good early progress as we expand to different markets across the world. Bitstamp continuing to scale volumes up two times since we closed in June. Bitstamp and engineering teams have been humming, so it's great to see so much progress here. We are also making progress expanding internationally. Now with three-quarters of a million customers outside the US.\n\nJust last week, we launched ISAs in the UK, which is the local tax advantage account in the UK. And this was actually the top request from our UK customer. So really excited to deliver it for them. I'm excited to watch these businesses scale as we launch in more and more new jurisdictions and we round out the product offerings. I think in a couple of years, we are going to look back, and we'll really have underestimated how big our international business can be. Now taking all of this together, our relentless product velocity has driven another strong year of results. Strong double-digit year-over-year market share gains across equities, options, crypto, margin.\n\nSo revenues, putting it all together, which were less than 3 billion a year ago, grew to 4.5 billion in 2025. So it's great to see that 50 plus percent revenue growth for the second straight year. So quite amazing. So before I get into our 2026 roadmap, which should be very fun, I'll turn it over to Shiv to walk through more of the business and financial results. Alright. Over to you, sir.\n\nWe are now up to 11 businesses with over $100 million in annualized revenue, and several more are making great progress. Including Robinhood Legend, which is really close and the gold card, which is on track for this year. Additionally, trade PMR, futures, index options, and Robinhood banking are all scaling really nicely. And third, in 2026, we plan to ramp up our product velocity even faster while delivering another year of profitable growth. There is a massive opportunity in front of us and we see the path to compound shareholder value for years to come. Alright. So let's review 2025 results, and this is all compared to last year. First, revenues were a record 4.5 billion.\n\nUp 52% year over year as Vlad said, and up over three times in the past three years. Adjusted EBITDA was also a record of 2.5 billion, up 76%. And adjusted EBITDA margins were also a new high of 56%. We also delivered incremental adjusted EBITDA margins above 70% for the third straight year. At the same time, we managed our share count closely leading to record EPS of $2.05. And our philosophy that the denominator matters. And over time, managing the share count closely should deliver value to shareholders. So let's look at Q4, and this is all compared to last year as well. First, revenues grew 27% to a record 1.3 billion.\n\nAs our customers remain engaged and continue to trust Robinhood Markets, Inc. with even more of their assets. Net deposits continued to be robust with over $16 billion of net deposits in Q4. That's our eighth straight quarter with over $10 billion of net deposits. And trading volumes grew to new highs across equities, options, futures, and event contracts, as we continue to win market share and saw record net buying from our customers. Interest-earning assets were also up 39% driven by strong growth in the cash sweep program, margin, and our credit card loan book. As we continue to win larger customers and deepen relationships with existing customers. Margin in particular has been great.\n\nWe believe shipping even more products and value to customers can deliver outsized growth for years to come. Second, we aim to deliver another year of 20% plus net deposit growth. This year, we reached nearly a third of a trillion dollars in assets across the platform, and we are well on our way to exceeding a trillion of assets in the coming years. With our rapid product velocity and the $100 trillion plus generational wealth transfer, already underway. And third, we built our plan to deliver another year of profitable growth.\n\nEven as we invest for growth, much like the robust revenue growth we've seen over the past few years, we are staying lean and disciplined, in the way we allocate capital operate as a business. So to our expense outlook, 2026, our outlook for adjusted OPEX and SBC is in a range of 2.6 to 2.725 billion. This translates to an 18% year over year expense growth at the midpoint which is below the 22% growth rate we managed to in 2025. On a comparable basis. So just to give you a little bit more color on how we built the plan, the 18% expense growth is in three areas.\n\nFirst, about five percentage points of that growth is going into our existing businesses. Net of any productivity improvements. These businesses drove the vast majority of our $1.5 billion of revenue growth in 2025, and we want to keep scaling them and gaining market share. Second, about three percentage points are from the full year cost effect of our 2025 acquisitions, of Bitstamp and TradePMR. Now these expenses will also come with a full year effect on revenue growth as well. And third, about 10 percentage points or more than half of the 18% growth is into new and scaling businesses, This is our biggest area of investment as we continue to accelerate product velocity.\n\nNow some of these investments include the Robinhood Gold Card, Robinhood Banking, strategies, prediction markets, Cortex, Robinhood Social, Robinhood Ventures, the Robinhood Chain, tokenized real-world assets, and continuing international expansion. It's a pretty long list. And as a reminder, we underwrite all investments to strong ROIs, and we'll stay nimble as we execute against our plan. And as I said at the outset, we'll continue to be lean and disciplined in the way we allocate and operate. Before turning it back to Vlad, I also just want to share a little bit on what we are seeing on the strong momentum into 2026.\n\nAs you saw in the release, in January, trading volumes were up over 50% year over year and options volumes were up 20%. We also had all-time highs in net buying, event contracts, futures, and margin. And while it's early, so far in February, the average daily trading volumes are up across all categories versus January levels. And Q1 net deposits are also off to a good start, with $7 billion plus so far in the quarter including over 2 billion last week. So it's fantastic to see customers engage to start the year. Putting it all together, we are incredibly excited about our plan and momentum entering 2026. As we work to drive another year of profitable growth.\n\nThe team continues to ship for customers, and our financial north star remains the same. Maximize earnings per share and free cash flow per share for shareholders over time. Vlad, back to you.\n\nVladimir Tenev: Thank you, Shiv. You're starting to get a taste of what this killer next to me can do in the CFO position, so very excited. We compromised by the way, Shiv prefers to stand, so we decided to do half the earnings call seated and half standing. Just over a year ago, we shared with you our ten-year vision for Robinhood Markets, Inc. at our Investor Day in New York City. We were excited about it back then, felt it was very ambitious, but I think in hindsight, we realize we underestimated what we could do in one year, not to mention ten years. So today, I'm going to tell you what we have planned for 2026.\n\nAnd we are by no means complacent. This is going to be an ambitious plan. As we continue to execute, Robinhood Markets, Inc. will become increasingly synonymous with the financial service category, as the financial super app. So let's get right into it, starting with what we are doing for active traders. Now I'm not going to go into every little detail of the roadmap. I'm going to prefer to focus on areas that are particularly meaningful. And maybe surprising. So prediction markets. Fastest growing business in our history. 300 million plus run rate in its first year.\n\nI think we are just at the beginning of a prediction market super cycle that could drive trillions in a\n\n[Transcript truncated for analysis]","source":"motley_fool","url":"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/10/robinhood-hood-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/"}
