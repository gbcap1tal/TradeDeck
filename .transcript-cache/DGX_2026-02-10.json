Strategic partnerships, including CoLab Solutions with Corewell Health and major consumer wearables collaborations, directly contributed to both volume and revenue gains while affecting near-term margin profiles due to lower initial profitability. The guidance for 2026 includes expanded operating margin expectations and revenue growth of 6%-7.1%, alongside temporary EPS dilution from Project Nova and the absorption of weather-related headwinds within its projections.\n\n\n## INDUSTRY GLOSSARY\n\n\n\n## Full Conference Call Transcript\n\n\nJim Davis: Thanks, Shawn, and good morning, everyone. With diligent execution of our strategy and a strong fourth quarter, we generated double-digit growth in revenues and earnings per share for the full year. In 2025, we expanded our category-defining clinical innovation to meet robust demand, formed strategic collaborations with elite health care organizations, and further advanced our position as the premier lab engine powering the wellness industry. We also continue to improve quality, productivity, and the customer and patient experience with process enhancements, AI, and automation.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2026, our guidance reflects our continued confidence in our business strengths and market fundamentals, which include favorable demographic trends, increasing use of blood-based lab diagnostics, and growing interest in preventative health and wellness.\n\nNow before I turn to this year’s highlights, I would like to take a moment to comment on PAMA. Last week, bipartisan legislation was enacted that delays the implementation of PAMA until 2026. This one-year delay in rate cuts was paired with an update to the data collection period to 2025 from 2019 based on the data to be supplied by applicable laboratories to CMS later this year. We greatly appreciate Congress for recognizing the need to reform PAMA and for providing this one-year delay of PAMA cuts, which provides meaningful short-term relief.\n\nHowever, these steps do not fix PAMA’s structural flaws, which include relying on an estimated 10,000 plus labs to self-report data to establish industry-representative data for payment rate setting. As a reminder, fewer than 1% of all the clinical laboratories reported commercial payer data to CMS in 2017, resulting in three rounds of excessive rate cuts based on data that did not reflect the market. A different approach is needed to prevent a repeat of excessive rate cuts.\n\nThe RESULTS Act provides a common-sense long-term solution that corrects these deficiencies by, for example, eliminating the need for thousands of labs to self-report data and instead leveraging an independent third-party database that provides comprehensive and representative data to set accurate market-based rates. We will continue to work with our trade association, ACLA, to build on progress in securing the necessary support in Congress to pass RESULTS into law this year.\n\nNow I will provide more detail on how we executed our strategy across our key customer channels and operations during the quarter and the year. We are focused on delivering solutions that meet the evolving needs of our core clinical customers, physicians and hospitals, as well as customers in the higher growth areas of consumer, life sciences, and data analytics. In the physician channel, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter on broad-based demand for our clinical solutions, including several areas of advanced diagnostics, and from geographic expansion resulting from increased health plan access. We also grew revenues in enterprise accounts as we added new customers and extended business with existing customers.\n\nIn addition, during the quarter, we scaled our lab testing to serve more than 200,000 patients at Fresenius Medical Care’s dialysis centers in the United States. We also added water purity testing capabilities to our menu to support dialysis customers nationwide.\n\nIn the hospital channel, revenues grew low single digits with Collaborative Lab Solutions driving our growth in the quarter. Our CoLab Solutions harness our lab and process management expertise to optimize quality and drive cost efficiencies in areas ranging from hospital lab and supply chain management to analytics and blood utilization. At the start of 2026, we began to scale our CoLab Solutions across all 21 hospitals of Corewell Health, a leading health system in Michigan, and our largest implementation of these solutions to date. We expect CoLab Solutions to generate approximately $1 billion in annual revenue in 2026.\n\nAdditionally, we recently finalized our laboratory joint venture with Corewell Health and are jointly constructing a state-of-the-art laboratory in Southeast Michigan from which we plan to serve the state in 2027. Hospitals value our flexible solutions for accessing expertise, innovation, and capital. We are pursuing several potential hospital outreach and independent lab acquisitions as well as CoLab opportunities while also continuing to integrate and generate value from our recent transactions.\n\nIn the consumer channel, we are leveraging our diagnostics expertise and technology to drive growth through our consumer-initiated test platform, questhealth.com, as well as through collaborations with industry-leading wellness and wearables companies. In the fourth quarter, we expanded questhealth.com to offer more than 150 tests, including our new 85-biomarker Elite Health Profile. Our innovation, quality, and technology integrated into existing apps and experiences make us the clear choice for organizations seeking to add diagnostic insights to their offerings. And we added new consumer brands to our extensive roster of collaborations in the fourth quarter.\n\nAt our Investor Day in March, we said that we would expect consumer-initiated testing to generate revenue growth in excess of 20%, and we exceeded that growth rate in 2025. Across the consumer channel, we delivered nearly $250 million in revenues for the full year.\n\nWe enable growth across our customer channels through faster growing advanced diagnostics in five key clinical areas: advanced cardiometabolic and endocrine, autoimmune, brain health, oncology, and women’s and reproductive health. During the quarter and full year, we delivered double-digit revenue growth across several clinical areas of our advanced portfolio. I would like to highlight a couple of these innovations today. Our Analyzer solution provides a comprehensive yet simple approach for aiding the diagnosis of the eight most common autoimmune disorders. About 24 million Americans suffer from at least one of over 100 autoimmune disorders. Because symptoms of these disorders often overlap, and a shortage of rheumatologists exists nationwide, patients may go for years before receiving the correct diagnosis.\n\nAnalyzer helps primary care clinicians identify the likely category of disease affecting the patient, and thereby speeding referral to the right specialist for faster diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn brain health, our portfolio of Quest AD-Detect blood tests for Alzheimer’s disease extended its year-long double-digit growth momentum into the fourth quarter as providers increasingly adopted the high-quality blood-based biomarker tests for the most prevalent type of dementia. A recent study by our scientific team suggests that blood tests like our newest AD-Detect panel, which fulfills guideline criteria for confirmatory blood testing, could decrease cost to the health care system by reducing the use of higher-cost PET/CT imaging for diagnosis, improving access and affordability. In oncology, we continue to build our presence in blood-based minimal residual disease testing.\n\nNew research presented at ASCO GI in early January highlighted the strong clinical value of our Haystack MRD test in monitoring for colorectal cancer. We further expanded in the MRD space with the launch last week of our cutting-edge flow MRD test for blood-based cancer myeloma. This test enables ultrasensitive detection of residual disease in a blood specimen, sparing patients the pain and complications of conventional testing of bone marrow biopsies.\n\nAlong with driving top-line growth across our business, we are focused on delivering operational excellence with enhanced processes and strategic implementation of automation, AI, and other advanced technologies. Through our INFIGURATE program, we achieved our full-year target of 3% annual cost savings and productivity improvements in 2025. Inside our labs, we deployed automated sample processing across our network and collaborative accessioning at multiple sites to streamline and optimize our processes. We also implemented the Hologic Genius Digital Diagnostic System at two of our laboratories and look forward to scaling this solution for enhancing quality and productivity in cervical cancer screenings at several of our labs this year.\n\nOutside the lab, we are using AI to make the customer and employee experiences easier, faster, and more insightful. For example, our virtual AI agent has reduced routine logistics calls by up to 50%, and we expect a new AI logistics tool will help us reduce courier transportation times as we roll it out this year. I will now turn the call over to Sam Samad for the financial results.\n\nSam Samad: Thanks, Jim. In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenues were $2.81 billion, up 7.1% versus the prior year. Consolidated organic revenues grew by 6.4%. Revenues for Diagnostic Information Services were up 7.3% compared to the prior year, reflecting organic growth in our physician, hospital, and consumer channels as well as recent acquisitions. Total volume, measured by the number of requisitions, increased 8.5% versus 2024, with organic volume up 7.9%. Total revenue per requisition was down 0.1% versus the prior year. As a reminder, Corewell Health and Fresenius Medical Care deliver significant volume growth at a lower revenue per requisition than our company average.\n\nExcluding these two relationships, our organic volume growth accelerated to 4.1% in the fourth quarter, while our revenue per requisition growth remained solid at approximately 3%. Unit price remained consistent with our expectations.\n\nReported operating income in the fourth quarter was $386 million, or 13.8% of revenues, compared to $361 million, or 13.8% of revenues, last year. On an adjusted basis, operating income was $429 million, or 15.3% of revenues, compared to $409 million, or 15.6% of revenues, last year. The adjusted operating income dollar increase was due to organic revenue growth and revenue growth from recent acquisitions, partially offset by wage increases. Operating income percent was reduced in the quarter by startup expenses related to Fresenius Medical Care and Corewell Health, as well as Project Nova expenses. Reported EPS was $2.18 in the quarter, and adjusted EPS was $2.42, compared to $1.95 and $2.23 the prior year, respectively.\n\nForeign exchange rates had no meaningful impact on our results.\n\nCash from operations was $1.89 billion for the full year 2025 versus $1.33 billion in the prior year. This significant year-over-year increase was driven by higher operating income, favorable working capital due to timing of disbursements, a cash tax benefit related to recent tax legislation, and the one-time CARES Act tax credit. As Jim said, we successfully executed on our strategy in 2025 to deliver these results, and we will continue to build on this as we progress through 2026.\n\nTurning now to our full-year 2026 guidance. Revenues are expected to be between $11.7 billion and $11.82 billion, which repres\n\n[Transcript truncated for analysis]","source":"motley_fool","url":"https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2026/02/10/quest-diagnostics-dgx-earnings-call-transcript/"}
