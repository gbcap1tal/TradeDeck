Measures whether big money is behind the stock.

RS Rating (0 to 1.0): RS ≥ 90 = 1.0. RS ≥ 80 = 0.5. Below 80 = 0.
Institutional Ownership (0 to 0.5): Scaled by market cap:
Large cap (≥ $10B): 50–95% = 0.5. 30–50% or >95% = 0.25. Below 30% = 0.
Mid cap ($2B–$10B): 30–80% = 0.5. 15–30% or >80% = 0.25. Below 15% = 0.
Small cap (<$2B): 20–60% = 0.5. 10–20% or >60% = 0.25. Below 10% = 0.
Smart Money (0 or 0.5): Insider buying in the last 12 months = 0.5. No insider buying = 0.
Pillar 3 — Earnings & Revenue Momentum (max 3.0 points)
Measures actual reported growth. Uses the data from the EPS and Sales tables (QoQ, YoY values). No forward estimates.

EPS QoQ trend (0 to 0.5): Looks at the last 3 reported quarters' QoQ EPS values. If the most recent 2 are both positive and increasing = 0.5. If at least 1 is positive = 0.25. All declining = 0.
Sales QoQ trend (0 to 0.5): Same logic as EPS QoQ but for revenue.
EPS Acceleration (0 to 0.5): Counts consecutive quarters where YoY EPS growth rate is increasing (each quarter's YoY growth is higher than the previous quarter's YoY growth). ≥ 2 quarters accelerating = 0.5. 1 quarter = 0.25. None = 0.
Sales Acceleration (0 to 0.5): Same logic as EPS acceleration but for revenue. ≥ 2 quarters = 0.5. 1 = 0.25. None = 0.

Checks structural health of the business.

Operating Margin Positive (0 or 0.5): Positive = 0.5. Negative = 0.
Free Cash Flow Positive (0 or 0.5): Positive FCF = 0.5. Negative = 0.
Market Cap (0 to 0.5): Above $10B = 0.5. Above $2B = 0.375. Above $300M = 0.25. Below $300M = 0.
Pillar 5 — Volume & Liquidity (max 1.0 points)
Ensures the stock is tradeable and has active participation.

Average Daily Volume 50D (0 to 0.5): ≥ 2M shares/day = 0.5. ≥ 1M = 0.375. ≥ 500K = 0.25. Below 500K = 0.
Volume Trend (0 to 0.5): Recent average volume (10-day) vs 50-day average. If 10D avg > 50D avg by ≥ 20% = 0.5 (rising demand). Within ±20% = 0.25 (neutral). 10D avg < 50D avg by > 20% = 0 (fading interest).
