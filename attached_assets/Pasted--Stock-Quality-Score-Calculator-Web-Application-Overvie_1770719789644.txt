# Stock Quality Score Calculator — Web Application

## Overview
Build a single-page web application that calculates a Stock Quality Score (1-10) for swing trading and investing. The user inputs stock data manually into a form, and the app calculates and displays a weighted score across 5 pillars.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or React — your choice)
- No backend needed — all calculations happen client-side
- Clean, dark-themed UI (similar to a trading terminal aesthetic — dark background, green/red accents for positive/negative values)
- Mobile responsive

## UI Layout

### Input Form
Create a form with 5 collapsible sections matching the 5 pillars below. Each field should have a label, an input, and a small helper text explaining what to enter.

### Results Panel
- Large circular or semi-circular gauge showing the total score (1-10) with color coding:
  - 8-10: Green — "A+ Setup"
  - 6.5-7.9: Yellow/Gold — "Strong — Wait for Entry"
  - 5-6.4: Orange — "Watchlist"
  - Below 5: Red — "Pass"
- Below the gauge, show a breakdown table with each pillar's score and a horizontal bar showing how much of the max was achieved
- At the bottom, show a text interpretation/recommendation based on the score and specific weaknesses detected

## SCORING ENGINE — EXACT LOGIC

### PILLAR 1: TREND & TECHNICAL STRUCTURE
**Weight: 30% | Max: 3.0 points**

**Inputs needed:**
- Weinstein Stage (dropdown: Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3, Stage 4)
- Price > 10 EMA (checkbox yes/no)
- Price > 20 EMA (checkbox yes/no)
- Price > 50 SMA (checkbox yes/no)
- Price > 200 SMA (checkbox yes/no)
- Distance from 50 SMA in % (number input)
- Overextension in ATR (number input)

**Scoring logic:**
1. Weinstein Stage:
   - Stage 2 = 1.0 pt
   - Stage 1 = 0.25 pt
   - Stage 3 or Stage 4 = 0 pt

2. Price > 10 EMA AND Price > 20 EMA:
   - Both true = 0.5 pt
   - Only one true = 0.25 pt
   - Neither = 0 pt

3. Price > 50 SMA AND Price > 200 SMA:
   - Both true = 0.5 pt
   - Only one true = 0.25 pt
   - Neither = 0 pt

4. Distance from 50 SMA:
   - ≤ 10% = 0.5 pt
   - 10.01% to 20% = 0.25 pt
   - > 20% = 0 pt

5. Overextension (ATR):
   - ≤ 2 ATR = 0.5 pt
   - 2.01 to 4 ATR = 0.25 pt
   - > 4 ATR = 0 pt

**Pillar 1 Total = sum of above (max 3.0)**

---

### PILLAR 2: DEMAND & INSTITUTIONAL FOOTPRINT
**Weight: 25% | Max: 2.5 points**

**Inputs needed:**
- RS Rating (number input, 0-99)
- Institutional Ownership % (number input)
- Average Volume 50D (number input — in shares, e.g. 1900000 for 1.9M)
- Smart Money (toggle: Yes / No — Yes means funds or insiders are buying in last 12 months)

**Scoring logic:**
1. RS Rating:
   - ≥ 90 = 1.0 pt
   - 80 to 89 = 0.5 pt
   - < 80 = 0 pt

2. Institutional Ownership:
   - 20% to 60% (inclusive) = 0.5 pt
   - < 20% OR > 60% = 0.25 pt

3. Average Volume 50D:
   - ≥ 1,000,000 = 0.5 pt
   - 500,000 to 999,999 = 0.25 pt
   - < 500,000 = 0 pt

4. Smart Money:
   - Yes = 0.5 pt
   - No = 0 pt

**Pillar 2 Total = sum of above (max 2.5)**

---

### PILLAR 3: GROWTH — QUARTERLY MOMENTUM
**Weight: 20% | Max: 2.0 points**

**Important context:** All "QoQ" values are actually Year-over-Year comparisons (same quarter vs same quarter prior year). The labels say QoQ but the data is YoY. TTM figures are NOT used in scoring — only quarterly data matters.

**Inputs needed:**
- Latest Quarter EPS YoY Growth % (number input — this is the "EPS QoQ" field from the data source)
- Latest Quarter Sales YoY Growth % (number input — this is the "Sales QoQ" field from the data source)
- Number of consecutive quarters where EPS YoY growth rate is INCREASING (number input, 0-8). Example: if EPS YoY went +12% → +26% → +30% across 3 quarters, that's 2 consecutive quarters of acceleration.
- Number of consecutive quarters where Sales YoY growth rate is INCREASING (number input, 0-8). Same logic as above.

**Scoring logic:**
1. Latest Quarter EPS YoY:
   - > 25% = 0.5 pt
   - 10% to 25% = 0.25 pt
   - < 10% = 0 pt

2. Latest Quarter Sales YoY:
   - > 15% = 0.5 pt
   - 5% to 15% = 0.25 pt
   - < 5% = 0 pt

3. EPS Acceleration:
   - ≥ 2 consecutive quarters of increasing YoY EPS growth = 0.5 pt
   - 1 quarter = 0.25 pt
   - 0 = 0 pt

4. Sales Acceleration:
   - ≥ 2 consecutive quarters of increasing YoY Sales growth = 0.5 pt
   - 1 quarter = 0.25 pt
   - 0 = 0 pt

**Pillar 3 Total = sum of above (max 2.0)**

---

### PILLAR 4: FORWARD ESTIMATES
**Weight: 15% | Max: 1.5 points**

**Inputs needed:**
- Number of upcoming estimated quarters showing EPS YoY growth ≥ 15% (number input, 0-4)
- Number of upcoming estimated quarters showing Sales YoY growth ≥ 10% (number input, 0-4)
- Are the estimated growth rates accelerating across future quarters? (dropdown: Yes / No / Mixed)

**Scoring logic:**
1. EPS Estimates:
   - ≥ 2 quarters with ≥ 15% YoY EPS growth = 0.5 pt
   - 1 quarter = 0.25 pt
   - 0 = 0 pt

2. Sales Estimates:
   - ≥ 2 quarters with ≥ 10% YoY Sales growth = 0.5 pt
   - 1 quarter = 0.25 pt
   - 0 = 0 pt

3. Estimate Acceleration:
   - Yes (growth rates increasing across future quarters) = 0.5 pt
   - Mixed = 0.25 pt
   - No (decelerating) = 0 pt

**Pillar 4 Total = sum of above (max 1.5)**

---

### PILLAR 5: STRUCTURE & RISK
**Weight: 10% | Max: 1.0 point**

**Inputs needed:**
- Operating Margin > 0 (checkbox yes/no)
- Free Cash Flow > 0 (checkbox yes/no)
- Float in millions (number input)
- Market Cap in millions (number input)

**Scoring logic:**
1. Operating Margin > 0:
   - Yes = 0.25 pt
   - No = 0 pt

2. FCF > 0:
   - Yes = 0.25 pt
   - No = 0 pt

3. Float:
   - < 100M = 0.25 pt
   - ≥ 100M = 0 pt

4. Market Cap:
   - > $300M = 0.25 pt
   - ≤ $300M = 0 pt

**Pillar 5 Total = sum of above (max 1.0)**

---

## TOTAL SCORE CALCULATION

**Total Score = Pillar 1 + Pillar 2 + Pillar 3 + Pillar 4 + Pillar 5**

Maximum possible = 3.0 + 2.5 + 2.0 + 1.5 + 1.0 = 10.0

---

## INTERPRETATION TEXT (display below the score)

Based on the total score, display:

- **8.0 - 10.0**: "A+ Setup — High conviction. Full size position warranted on proper entry."
- **6.5 - 7.9**: "Strong Setup — Standard position size. Wait for a clean technical entry (pullback to 10/20 EMA)."
- **5.0 - 6.4**: "Watchlist — Needs improvement in key areas. Monitor for catalyst or technical setup improvement."
- **Below 5.0**: "Pass — Too many weaknesses. Look elsewhere."

Additionally, generate specific warnings:
- If Overextension > 4 ATR: "⚠️ Overextended — do NOT chase. Wait for pullback."
- If Dist from 50 SMA > 20%: "⚠️ Far from 50 SMA — elevated risk of mean reversion."
- If Pillar 3 (Growth) < 0.5: "ℹ️ Weak fundamentals — this is a momentum/story stock. Manage risk accordingly."
- If Pillar 5 (Structure) < 0.5: "ℹ️ Not yet profitable — position size conservatively."
- If Smart Money = No AND RS < 80: "⚠️ No institutional support detected."
