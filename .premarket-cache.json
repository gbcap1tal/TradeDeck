We saw renewed commitments to nuclear energy from governments, utilities, and industrial energy users around the world, including policies that continued to reinforce nuclear's critical role in delivering secure, reliable and carbon-free baseload power. That support was accompanied by increasing long-term contracting activity towards the end of the year, with a deepening focus on security of supply, and rising interest from existing and emerging nuclear markets, including traditional utilities and new industrial energy users that are considering nuclear. Utilities continue to seek dependable supply in an environment where finite secondary supplies are thinning, and it is becoming more obvious each day that potential new production is expected to be challenged by longer-than-advertised lead times, mounting inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainty. The underlying message is clear to us: the fundamentals that have been steadily improving over the past several years gained further traction in 2025, and we expect these trends to continue through 2026 and beyond.\n• Additionally, the value-accretive contributions from our Westinghouse investment continue to outperform the acquisition case expectations. The segment continued to positively impact our overall results in 2025, including a 30% increase in adjusted EBITDA over 2024, reflecting strong underlying performance across its core businesses. We also benefited from a cash distribution from Westinghouse of US$350 million, with US$171.5 million representing our share, tied to its participation in the Dukovany nuclear project. While we don't expect a comparable additional distribution this year, the 2026 guidance for Westinghouse remains strong and reinforces the value of our investment, highlighting Westinghouse's role as a stable, long-term player within a strengthening global nuclear market.\n• Looking forward, we believe we will continue to see a durable trend of growth across the nuclear fuel cycle supported by electrification, energy security and decarbonization priorities, and the increasing recognition that nuclear must play a central role in addressing the world's long-term energy challenges. Cameco is well positioned to benefit from this global shift, driving long-term value for our shareholders, our customers, and the communities where we operate.\""},{"time":"06:36","ticker":"AGCC","headline":"Agencia Comercial Spirits entered into nonbinding letters of intent to evaluate AI computing infrastructure and data center opportunities","body":"• Proposed AI Server Lease Framework with Ricloud (Nonbinding Letter of Intent): On January 15, 2026, the Company entered into a letter of intent with Ricloud AI Inc. setting out preliminary terms under which the Company is evaluating a proposed lease arrangement involving high performance AI computing servers based on the NVIDIA B300 platform (Blackwell architecture).
