Among all participants in the auction, TELUS successfully obtained the most spectrum at an attractive price. This positions TELUS as an industry leader with an average of 104 MHz of prime 5G mid-band spectrum in the 3500 and 3800 MHz bands nationally, acquired for an average price of $0.82 per MHz-pop. This will further support TELUS' efforts to always be building Canada. The 3800 MHz band is mid-range spectrum that has become the critical global band for 5G innovation, as it offers the best combination of speed -- due to its wide channels -- and coverage.
